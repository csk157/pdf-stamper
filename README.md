## Data format

### Template specifications

Each template specification is for a one page document, describing "holes" on a PDF page. These holes contain a number of fields:

- `:height` - in PDF points
- `:width` - in PDF points
- `:x` - in PDF points
- `:y` - in PDF points
- `:name` - the name of this hole on the page, e.g. `:head/hole-number`
- `:type` - `:image` or `:text`
- `:format` - a map of maps containing the keys `:font`, `:style`, `:size`, `:color`, `:spacing`
  - `:paragraph`
  - `:bullet`
  - `:number`
  - `:head-1`
  - `:head-2`
  - `:head-3`
- `:priority` - when in the drawing process to write this hole to the PDF

`:x, :y` defines the top left corner of the hole on the PDF template page. `:height` and `:width` should be self-explanatory.

`:priority` is effectively a layering of the contents on template pages; e.g. if you have two overlapping holes on a template the one with the lowest value in `:priority` will be drawn on the page first, and the other hole on top of that.

`:format` is only necessary for text holes. The keys `:font` and `:size` must be in points (`pt`), not pixels (`px`). `:color` must be an RGB vector, i.e. `[red green blue]`. `:spacing` is a map with the keys `:before` and `:after`, each of which is in points.

The template format is [EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn).

Example:

```clojure
{:height 10.0
 :width 10.0
 :x 1.09
 :y 3.12
 :name :head/hole-number
 :type :image
 :priority 10}
```

### Program input

Input to the program consists of two fields:

- `:style` - which template style to use for the pages
- `:pages` - an ordered list of data for the pages

Each entry in the `:pages` list is a map with the following keys:

- `:location` - matches a `:name` in a template specification and is where this data will be inserted
- `:kind` - which page template to use, e.g. `:hole_2_sponsors`
- `:locations` - what to put on this page

Keys in the `:locations` map match `:name` keys in the template specification; the values' contents depend on the `:type` of the hole in the template. For `:image`:

- `:image` - a `java.awt.BufferedImage`

For `:text`:

- `:text` - the actual text to insert

The text is XML/HTML. The string must consist of a top-level element containing the entire text. Only the following tags are handled with formatting:

- Paragraph level tags:
  - `h1-3` as headings
  - `p` as paragraphs
  - `ul` as bullet lists
  - `ol` as numbered lists
- Character level tags:
  - `em` as emphasized text (i.e. italics)
  - `i` same as `em`
  - `strong` as bold text
  - `b` same as `strong`

Paragraph level tags cannot be nested.

If a word is longer than the by the template specified width, three dots (`...`) are written instead of that word.

Input to the program is, like the template specifications, in [EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn).

Example (a one page document):

```clojure
{:style :regular
 :pages [{:kind :hole_2_sponsors
          :locations {:head/hole-number {:text "<t>1</t>"}}]}
```

## TODO: Fonts

The library supports the standard fonts of [PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/). To include custom fonts, use ...

In the templates fonts are specified by a combination of their names (as a keyword) and a style (a set of keywords). If a font in a template is not found a default font is used (currently Times New Roman) with the chosen style; if the style is not found either it will default to the regular font.
